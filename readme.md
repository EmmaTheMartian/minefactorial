# MineFactorial

(aka: Mine! or M!)

> A revival of MineFactory Reloaded for modern versions of Minecraft.

Before anyone says it: Yes this mod is similar to Industrial Foregoing. Both it and M!
are based on MFR, so there will be a lot of similarities and overlap. I'm trying my best
to stay unique and diverge from what is seen in IF though.
